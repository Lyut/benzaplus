Educational partial code of an ExtJS application to search and visualize real-time Italian gas prices.
There are two tabs, a "workspace" where you can see the map with markers, and a "data" tab where you have a sortable grid of results.

The endpoints where gas prices are obtained have been removed from the code as they were obtained reverse engineering government websites.
